We built this project as part of ETH Bogota to demonstrate our vision of better accessibility of the web3 ecosystem.
We believe the adoption can vastly improve by enabling users more easily to access the DeFi ecosystem. Users are automatically on the right network and don't have to waste thoughts on that. We abstract away waiting times by performing transactions in the background.
