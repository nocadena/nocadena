# Vision

We believe conventional wallets are not ready for the multi-chain/appchain future. Current wallets require the user to think in chains and to bridge their assets manually leading to poor UX due to high fees and long wait times. On the other hand, CeFi solutions are isolated from DeFi, centralised and have high fees. 
With our solution, we want to oppose the prevalent “thinking in chains” and build a UX that onboards the next billion users by utilizing a master chain which acts as a register for the user’s funds and multiple satellite chains where the user’s funds are escrowed.

# UX

Hence, in terms of UX, very differently to all available wallets out there, we are not exposing the user to **ANY** technical details.
This implies that they can just log in using their social logins (e.g. Google, Facebook etc) as they are used to. Once logged in, they can see their assets but don't have to consider which chains their assets are on. They can still interact with all DeFi protocols through the app and moving their funds will be taken care of in the background.
